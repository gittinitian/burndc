BurnDC V1.0 by Dean Thomson (https://code.fsociety.info/burndc)
2016 MIT License.

Dependencies:
cdrecord

I will add options later on to change the dev id of the scsi burner.
Later on I'll also add a parameter change burn speed.  But for the
time being this is the first working Linux Dreamcast CDI burning
script in years.

How to Use:
- Copy cdirip and dcburn to a directory where your $PATH can read it.
- Enter the directory where the CDI is.
- Type in burndc (nameofgame).cdi
- Put in CD
- Win :)

Enjoy.
